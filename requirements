1) Incorporate Rshiny to build relevant graphs? Or using d3 is OK?
2) Create UCSC custom tracks and get links on website OR embed IGV
3) Fill in the sections yet unfilled with relevant information
4) Create links to fastqc files
5) Make it so that the graphs generated on gene_view.php form for 
  user's selected gene AND genome (so if user searched rn4 sox9, only 
  generate graph for rn4 sox9. if searched all genomes and sox9, generate 
  2 graphs for sox9)
